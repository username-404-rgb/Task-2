## Build and Test
    First code here

## Review
    System meets all requirements set for sprint 1
    Performance is high, as it is currently a simple program and doesn't use many resources
    Code needs to be organised better for future sprints, and I need to catch up
    Sould bring in function use for sprint two to make it easier to program
